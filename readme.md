We implemented [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1401905/) by Tschumperle et al. on the PDE-based regularization of vector-valued images. A detailed report on methods and results can be found as [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf) or [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!ArBhB_fWzdvv90E0VYxRTfclPE3s).
